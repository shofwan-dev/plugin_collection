API reference
Use the Paddle API to create, read, and update information in your Paddle system.

The Paddle API is a REST API that lets you integrate Paddle into your app and work with the data in your Paddle system. It uses JSON formatted data for requests and responses.

Use the Paddle API to:

Create, read, and update all the information in your Paddle system.
Integrate Paddle with your app to build signup and other subscription management workflows.
Plug Paddle into other systems that your business uses, like CRM, ERP, or accounting solutions.

Base URL
The base URLs for the Paddle API are the same for all endpoints. The API version is specified a header in your API request rather than in the path.

Use different URLs for sandbox and live accounts:

Sandbox
Your sandbox account is for evaluation and testing. All transactions are tests, meaning transactions are simulated and any money isn't real.


https://sandbox-api.paddle.com/
Live
Your live account is where customers can make purchases. Transactions are real, meaning payment methods are charged and you earn real money.


https://api.paddle.com/

Authentication
Use Bearer authentication with API keys when making requests to the Paddle API.

Paddle offers two types of authentication credentials:

API keys
Used to interact with the Paddle API in your backend. For example, building subscription upgrade and downgrade workflows.

Intended only for server-side use.
Has full access to your data, limited only by the permissions assigned to the API key.
Must be kept secure and secret.
Client-side tokens
Used to work with Paddle.js in your frontend. For example, launching a checkout and previewing prices or transactions.

Intended only for client-side use.
Limited to opening checkouts, previewing prices, and previewing transactions.
Safe to publish in your app code.
This reference is about authenticating requests to the Paddle API in your backend. Don't call the Paddle API directly in your frontend. Use Paddle.js with client-side tokens instead.

Get an API key
An API key is required to authenticate requests to the Paddle API.

Create an API key

Keys can be created for either sandbox or live environments. Go to Paddle > Developer tools > Authentication to create a key.

Assign permissions

Permissions control what entities and operations the API key can access. Requests by keys without the required permissions fail with a forbidden error (403).

Check format

Your API key should be 69 characters long, be prefixed with pdl_, contain apikey_, and contain sdbx_ or live_ depending on the environment.

Treat your API key like a password. Keep it safe and never share it with apps or people you don't trust.

Authenticate requests
All requests to the Paddle API require authentication unless explicitly stated. The API uses Bearer authentication.

To authenticate, pass your Paddle API key using the Authorization header and the Bearer prefix. For example:


Authorization: Bearer pdl_live_apikey_01gtgztp8f4kek3yd4g1wrksa3_q6TGTJyvoIz7LDtXT65bX7_AQO
Endpoints in the API have an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to block direct access from browsers.

Test authentication
The quickest way to test authentication is to send a request to the /event-types endpoint. This endpoint returns data even without any entities in Paddle and doesn't require any permissions.

Live
Sandbox
cURL request

curl https://api.paddle.com/event-types -H "Authorization: Bearer pdl_live_apikey_01gtgztp8f4kek3yd4g1wrksa3_q6TGTJyvoIz7LDtXT65bX7_AQO"
Response
If successful, you should get a response that includes a data array and a meta object.

200 OK

{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "transaction.billed",
      "description": "Occurs when a transaction is billed. Its status field changes to billed and billed_at is populated.",
      "group": "Transaction",
      "available_versions": [
        1
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "transaction.canceled",
      "description": "Occurs when a transaction is canceled. Its status field changes to canceled.",
      "group": "Transaction",
      "available_versions": [
        1
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "transaction.completed",
If unsuccessful, Paddle returns a 403 error with information about what went wrong and how to troubleshoot.

Check the permissions assigned to your API key at Paddle > Developer tools > Authentication to ensure the key works with the endpoint you're trying to access.

Common errors
authentication_missing	The request doesn't include an Authorization header. Check that you're provided a header using Bearer authentication in your request.
authentication_malformed	The Authorization header is in the wrong format. Check that you set the Authorization header to Bearer <INSERT_API_KEY>.
invalid_token	The API key you're trying to access isn't correct. Check that you have provided the correct API key, that it's in the correct environment, and that it hasn't been revoked.
forbidden	The API key you're trying to use doesn't have the required permissions to perform the requested action. Check that the API key has the necessary permissions.

Permissions
Limit an API key's access to specific entities and actions in Paddle.

Permissions control what API keys can do. They help you keep data secure by limiting each key to only the access it needs. You can create different keys with tailored permissions for different users, teams, or systems. This acts as a guardrail, preventing unauthorized access to your entire account.

When creating or updating an API key, you can assign it specific permissions.

Permissions are scoped to specific entities in Paddle, such as products, customers, or transactions. You can select two types of permission to determine what the key can do with an entity:

Read - Entity (Read) or {entity}.read

Read, list, and use the include parameter to include the entity in a response. Works for GET requests and preview requests (using POST or PATCH).

Write - Entity (Write) or {entity}.write

Create, update, archive, and delete the entity. Works for POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests. Having write permission for an entity automatically includes read permission for that entity.

Select the correct permissions
The permissions a key needs depend on the operation being performed and what entities it's accessing.

Permissions required
You do need permissions when working with:

Operations that access entities

For operations that return or take action on an entity, your API key needs permission for that entity.

Example: Listing adjustments requires the adjustment.read permission.

Responses enriched with entities

When using the include parameter to enrich a response, your API key needs permission for any included entities.

Example: Listing prices with include=product requires both price.read and product.read permissions.

Entities that return customer portal URLs

When a response can include authenticated URLs linking to the customer portal, your API key needs the customer_portal_session.write permission or they are not returned.

Example: Without the customer_portal_session.write permission, listing subscriptions doesn't return the management_urls object containing authenticated links.

Entities to populate in simulated webhooks

When providing an entity ID in config.entities, your API key needs permission to read that entity and any related entities included in webhook payloads but not nested in the parent. For the entity you're attempting to populate, the request fails without the read permission. For related entities, static examples are used if the key has no read permissions.

Example: Creating a notification simulation with config.entities.subscription_id requires the subscription.read permission or the request fails. Without the transaction.read permission, related transactions will fall back to static examples in simulated payloads. Transactions aren't nested in subscriptions by default.

Permissions not required
You don't need permissions when working with:

Nested entities in responses

When an operation returns different entities within the primary entity's response, these nested entities are included even without specific permissions for them.

Example: A transaction response contains prices in the items array. These are included even if you only have transaction.read permission and not price.read.

Indirectly created or updated entities

Operations that indirectly create or update entities don't require additional write permissions for those generated entities.

Example: Creating an adjustment that updates a transaction only requires adjustment.write, not transaction.write.

Parent entities

If an entity has a parent entity, it isn't a prerequisite that the permissions for the parent entities are needed.

Example: Retrieving an address for a customer uses both address and customer path parameters, but only requires address.read, not customer.read.

Requests made with API keys that don't have the required permissions return a forbidden error (403).

Manage API keys
Create, update, and revoke API keys used to authenticate server-side requests to the Paddle API.

API keys are secure credentials that authenticate your requests to the Paddle API. They give you programmatic access to create transactions, manage subscriptions, and work with other entities in your Paddle account.

They're intended only for server-side use.
They have full access to your data, limited only by the permissions assigned to the API key.
They must be kept secure and secret.
By integrating with the Paddle API using API keys, you can handle provisioning, build more granular custom payment flows, and automate tasks.

Looking to integrate Paddle in your frontend? Use Paddle.js with client-side tokens instead.
How it works
When you make requests to the Paddle API, include your API key in the Authorization header to authenticate your request. Paddle uses your API key to identify your account and verify that you have permission to perform the requested action.

Example authenticated request to view all transactions

curl -X GET "https://api.paddle.com/transactions" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer pdl_sdbx_apikey_01gtgztp8f4kek3yd4g1wrksa3_q6TGTJyvoIz7LDtXT65bX7_AQO"
You're in control over the security and use of your API keys, with key features including:

Use separate API keys for testing
Use separate API keys for sandbox and live environments to safely test without affecting production data.

Check the format of your API keys
Each key follows a standardized format to make it easier to identify and avoid issues when making requests.

Limit access using permissions
Assign permissions to your API keys to control what actions they can perform.

Expire and rotate your API keys
Limit the lifetime of your API keys and rotate them regularly to reduce the risk of exposure.

Automatic secret scanning
Paddle automatically detects exposed API keys in code repositories and takes the required action to keep your account safe.

Store and use API keys securely
Follow best practices and treat your API keys as sensitive security credentials.

Sandbox vs live
Paddle has separate sandbox and live environments, each with their own set of API keys. This separation helps you safely test your integrations, avoids impacting real customer data, and reduces the risk of exposing your API keys.

Sandbox API keys
Use these keys as you build and test your integration.

They only work in the sandbox environment where no real money is involved.

Sandbox API keys created after May 6, 2025 contain sdbx_.

Create a sandbox API key in the sandbox dashboard.

Live API keys
Use these keys only when you're ready to process real transactions in your production app.

They only work in the live environment where real money is involved.

Live API keys created after May 6, 2025 contain live_.

Create a live API key in the live dashboard.

Format
All API keys created after May 6, 2025 follow the standard format. You can identify these keys by the prefix pdl_. Keys created before this date follow the legacy format.

API keys always follow a specific format.

Standard format
Legacy format
Always start with pdl_ to identify them as Paddle API keys.
Contain either live_ or sdbx_ after the prefix to identify the environment they're used for.
Have apikey_ after the environment to identify them as API keys instead of client-side tokens.
Have five underscores (_) within the key.
Are 69 characters in length.
Example of standard format API keys

pdl_live_apikey_01gtgztp8f4kek3yd4g1wrksa3_q6TGTJyvoIz7LDtXT65bX7_AQO
pdl_sdbx_apikey_01gtgztp8f4kek3yd4g1wrksa3_q6TGTJyvoIz7LDtXT65bX7_AQO
Regex pattern for standard format API keys

^pdl_(live|sdbx)_apikey_[a-z\d]{26}_[a-zA-Z\d]{22}_[a-zA-Z\d]{3}
API keys are case-sensitive.

Permissions
When you create an API key, you must select which permissions to assign to it. You can select multiple permissions for a single key.

You can have multiple API keys with different permissions. This lets you control which app or integration has access to which parts of your Paddle account.

To change the permissions assigned to an API key, edit the API key.

Requests made with API keys that don't have the required permissions return a forbidden error (403).

Expiration
API keys can have an expiry date. This is the date when the API key is no longer valid. Expiry dates are useful to limit the lifetime of a key and reduce the risk of exposure.

You can set the expiry date when you create the API key. The default expiry date is 90 days from the date of creation and can't be more than one year from the date of creation.

We strongly recommend setting an expiry date for your API keys. API keys can be used to access sensitive data and should be rotated regularly.

You can subscribe to receive an email or a webhook when API keys are expiring and when they have expired:

api_key.expiring	Occurs when an API key expires in seven days.
api_key.expired	Occurs when an API key has expired.
When you get a notification, rotate your API keys before they expire.

Once a key has expired, it's no longer valid and can't be revalidated. Create a new API key to rotate.

You can't update the expiry date of an existing API key. If you need to change the expiry date, you must create a new API key and revoke the old one.

Secret scanning
Paddle automatically monitors public repositories on GitHub to detect when your API keys are accidentally exposed. This helps protect your account from unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

When an API key is detected in a repository, Paddle assesses the risk level and takes appropriate action.

Risk level	Meaning	API key status
High	Exposed publicly, like in a public GitHub repository.	Automatically revoked to protect your account.
Low	Already expired or revoked.	Already inactive.
The recommended follow-up actions you should take depend on the risk level:

High
Low
When an exposure is detected, you'll receive an immediate notification through email. These are sent automatically to the owner of your Paddle account.

You can optionally subscribe to webhook notifications for API key exposure events.

Webhook	Description
api_key_exposure.created	Occurs when an exposure is detected.
api_key.revoked	Occurs when a key is automatically revoked.
All exposures are tracked and visible in the dashboard for transparency and security auditing.

Best practices
Your API key is a sensitive security credential. It gives you access to your Paddle account and can be used to make changes to your account. If bad actors gain access to your API key, it can harm your business.

Treat your API key like a password. Keep it safe and never share it with apps or people you don't trust.

For this reason, API keys can only ever be viewed once and must immediately be stored securely after creation. If you lose your API key, you must revoke it and create a new one.

You and your team are responsible for storing your API keys safely. Follow these best practices to help protect your API keys:

Always
Set an expiry date for your API keys.

Rotate your API keys regularly.

Use environment variables or credential management systems to store your API key.

Never
Share your API key in emails or chat.

Hardcode your API key in your code.

Include API keys in client-side code.

Store your API key in a public or accessible location.

Edit an API key
You can edit the name, description, and permissions assigned to an API key. You can't update:

Expiry dates

You must create a new API key with the desired expiry date and revoke the old one.

Expired keys

Once keys have expired, they're no longer valid and can't be revalidated. Create a new API key and rotate the old key.

Go to Paddle > Developer Tools > Authentication.

Click the API keys tab.

Click the overflow button button next to the API key you want to edit, then choose Edit

Enter a new name and description for the API key.

Select and clear the permissions you want to assign and unassign from the API key.

Revoke an API key
You can revoke an API key at any time. You might do this when a key is expiring. We recommend rotating keys at regular intervals for your security.

Revoked API keys have a 60-minute grace period during which you can reactivate the key. After this time, the key is permanently revoked. You must create a new API key.

Go to Paddle > Developer Tools > Authentication.

Click the API keys tab.

Click the overflow button button next to the API key you want to revoke, then choose Revoke

Confirm you want to revoke the API key by filling in the confirmation box, then clicking Revoke

Reactivate an API key
API keys have a 60-minute grace period to be reactivated after they're revoked. They can only be reactivated if they were revoked by a user and not by Paddle.

You can't reactivate an API key after this grace period has expired. You must create a new API key.

Legacy keys created before May 6, 2025 and API keys that were automatically revoked by Paddle, like those that had high risk exposures, can't be reactivated. Create a new standard format API key instead.

Go to Paddle > Developer Tools > Authentication.

Click the API keys tab.

Click the overflow button button next to the API key you want to reactivate, then choose Reactivate

Click Reactivate

Review the status
Identify the status of API keys to determine what actions, if any, you should take.

Active

The key is valid and can be used to authenticate requests. Audit where and when it's used.

Expiring soon

The key is approaching its expiry date. Plan to rotate it before it expires.

Expired

The key has expired past its expiry date. Replace it with a new key if you haven't already.

Illustration of the authentication screen in Paddle. It shows the API keys tab. There's a list of API keys with their status and last used date for each.

Check the last used date
For all keys that are active, check the Last used column to see when each key was last used. Look for:

Unexpected usage that could indicate a compromised key.

Inactive keys that may be candidates for rotation or removal.

Keys that were rotated recently to confirm they're no longer used.

If any of the above apply, rotate or revoke the keys.

Illustration of the authentication screen in Paddle. It shows the API keys tab. There's a list of API keys with their status and last used date for each.

View API key exposures
View details about any API key exposures that have been detected by Paddle's secret scanning system.

Review exposure details
For each exposure, you can see:

Risk level	High or Low based on the exposure circumstances.
Detection date	When the exposure was discovered.
Source	Where this exposure occurred.
Reference	Where the key was exactly found as exposed.
Action taken	Whether the key was automatically revoked.
Use this information to:

Understand how the exposure occurred.

Audit for any unauthorized usage and determine if you need to rotate the key.

Improve your security practices to prevent future exposures.

Common errors
invalid_token	The API key you're trying to access isn't correct. Check that you have provided the correct API key, that it's in the correct environment, and that it hasn't been revoked.
forbidden	The API key you're trying to use doesn't have the required permissions to perform the requested action. Check that the API key has the necessary permissions.
Events
api_key.created	Occurs when an API key is created.
api_key.updated	Occurs when an API key is updated.
api_key.expiring	Occurs when an API key expires in seven days.
api_key.expired	Occurs when an API key has expired.
api_key.revoked	Occurs when an API key is revoked.
api_key_exposure.created	Occurs when an API key has been detected as exposed.

Rotate API keys
Keep your app secure by regularly rotating API keys when they expire or are exposed.

Regularly rotating API keys is a security best practice that helps protect accounts from unauthorized access. By setting expiry dates and creating new keys before old ones expire, you can minimize the risk of API keys being compromised without disrupting your app.

You may also need to rotate keys immediately due to security incidents, like a key being exposed.

How it works
API key rotation is the process of replacing existing API keys with new ones.

API keys can be created with an expiry date. Once an API key expires, it can no longer be used to authenticate requests to the Paddle API. This encourages you to change your keys at a regular interval.

Paddle also automatically scans to find keys that have been exposed in public and private repositories through a process called secret scanning. If a key is exposed, it may be revoked automatically, or you may be notified to rotate it.

Before you begin
Create an API key with an expiry date. If an API key has no expiry date, you can still rotate keys but you aren't notified when the key is about to expire.

We strongly recommend setting an expiry date for your API keys. API keys can be used to access sensitive data and should be rotated regularly.

It's good practice to regularly check your API keys in Paddle > Developer tools > Authentication and ensure none are approaching their expiry date without a replacement being prepared, or none have had exposures that require immediate action.

Overview
Rotating your API keys follows this workflow:

Set up notifications

Get notified when a key is about to expire, has expired, or is exposed.

Create a new API key

Grab a new key immediately or before the current one expires.

Store and use the new key

Transition to using the new key in your app.

Check API key activity

Verify the new key works and the old key is no longer used.

Revoke the old key

Stop the old key from working and remove it.

1
Set up notifications
Paddle can notify you when a key is about to expire, has expired, or is exposed to make the rotation process easier and more secure.

Get notified when a key is about to expire or has expired
Get notified when a key is exposed
2
Create a new API key
Create a new API key as soon as possible. Plan for an overlap period between old and new keys to allow for a smooth transition without disruption to your app.

If you're rotating due to an exposure, prioritize security over convenience and consider revoking the exposed key first.

When creating a new API key:

Assign the same permissions as the current key.
Set an appropriate expiry date.
Add a descriptive name that includes its purpose, team if applicable, and expiry date for easier management.
Illustration showing an open drawer to create a new API key. There's a field to enter the name and a field to enter the description.

API keys can't be created and rotated programmatically. New keys must be manually created in the dashboard and updated in your app.

3
Store and use the new API key
API keys are only visible once upon creation.

Store the key safely and replace the old key in all places where your app uses it.

We recommend using a key management system with version control to track changes to your API keys. This makes it easier to manage key rotation and revert changes if needed.

Follow these optional steps to minimize the risk when transitioning to the new API key.

Illustration showing an open modal to copy the API key. There's instructions on saving and a button that says Copy.

Verify your new key works
Use old and new keys simultaneously
4
Check API key activity
After updating your app to use the new key, check that:

The new key is working properly

Test the integration to verify that requests using the new API key are successful. Look at logs, errors, latency, and other metrics to ensure the new key is working properly.

The old key is no longer being used

Check the last used date of the old API key in Paddle > Developer Tools > Authentication. If the date hasn't changed since the update, it indicates that the old key is no longer being used anywhere in your app.

Illustration of the authentication screen in Paddle. It shows the API keys tab. There's a list of API keys with the last used date for each.

5
Revoke the old key
Once you've verified that your app is successfully using the new key and the old key is no longer in use, you can safely revoke the old API key instead of waiting for it to expire.

Keep checking your logs to ensure there are no errors upon revoking the old key.

If a key is accidentally revoked while still in use or errors appear in logs, there is a 60-minute grace period to reactivate the API key. Reactivation isn't possible if the key was revoked due to an exposure.

If everything is working as expected, you can safely remove the old key from your key management system, environment variables, or any other places where it's stored. This includes the value of the OLD_PADDLE_KEY if you opted to use two keys simultaneously when switching.

Versioning
We update the Paddle API version when making breaking changes. Specify the version using the Paddle-Version header when making requests.

When we make breaking changes to the Paddle API, we release a new version. We version using sequential numbering.

The current version of the Paddle API is version 1.

Older versions of the API continue to work as before when we release new versions. We don't automatically change your API version, so your integrations continue to work until you're ready to upgrade.

We update our developer changelog whenever we change our API or developer tools. Updates include comprehensive information about what's changed and how to upgrade. See Developer changelog

Breaking changes
A breaking change is a change that may require you to make changes to your code to keep your integrations working. They're sometimes called backwards incompatible changes.

Some examples of breaking changes:

Removing or renaming a parameter or field.
Removing or renaming an endpoint or operation.
Removing functionality from an endpoint.
Adding stricter validation for a field.
Changing error handling.
We don't automatically change your API version. You can opt in to new versions of the API in the dashboard when you're ready.

Non-breaking changes
We may make non-breaking changes to the API. These are changes that don't disrupt existing workflows, so you can adopt them at your own pace. They're sometimes called backwards compatible changes.

Some examples of non-breaking changes:

Adding new endpoints or operations.
Adding new fields to responses.
Adding new optional request parameters.
Changing field ordering in responses.
We'll update our developer changelog with information about non-breaking changes.

Specify a version
Your default version
When you sign up for Paddle, the latest version of the Paddle API is set as your default version.

We use this version of the API to respond to API requests where you don't explicitly set a version of the API.

Webhook destinations don't use your default version. You can set the API version that you want to use when creating a webhook destination.

Specify in requests
To specify a version of the Paddle API when making a request, include a Paddle-Version header with your request. For example:

cURL request

curl https://api.paddle.com/event-types 
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pdl_live_apikey_01gtgztp8f4kek3yd4g1wrksa3_q6TGTJyvoIz7LDtXT65bX7_AQO" 
  -H "Paddle-Version: 1"
You don't need to specify a version with your request, but it's good practice. Paddle uses your default version when you don't include a version header.

You can't use a version of the API that's earlier than your default version.

The Paddle-Version header that you send takes priority over your account's default version. This means you can test versions of the API that are later than your default version.

Deprecation
We don't deprecate older versions of our API right now. We'll communicate future announcements around deprecation in plenty of time.

Paddle IDs
Paddle IDs are unique identifiers for entities in Paddle. They easily identifiable by type and lexicographically sortable.

Every entity in Paddle has a unique identifier, called a Paddle ID. Paddle IDs are made up of a prefix for the kind of entity, followed by a unique string of 26 alphanumeric characters.

Prefixes are typically three characters, but may be longer. They're distinctive, so it's easy to tell what kind of entity you're working with when using a Paddle ID.

Common examples
For example, here are some common Paddle IDs:

Entity	Prefix	Regex	Example
Address	add_	^add_[a-z\d]{26}$	add_01gt202fr8131gahn63v9tczgm
Adjustment	adj_	^adj_[a-z\d]{26}$	adj_01ghvjt9dbpnndeqjve8cktgqs
Business	biz_	^biz_[a-z\d]{26}$	biz_01gsz92krfzy3hcx5h5rtgnfwz
Customer	ctm_	^ctm_[a-z\d]{26}$	ctm_01gt202fpjt0e63p942gw4ybvh
Discount	dsc_	^dsc_[a-z\d]{26}$	dsc_01gt218xfk7yztpvgmcazkes83
Event	evt_	^evt_[a-z\d]{26}$	evt_01gt261mpgnbg1f3875zx2dsrd
Notification	ntf_	^nft_[a-z\d]{26}$	ntf_01gtyac3x932yhfppx6w9x4zsb
Notification destination	nftset_	^nftset_[a-z\d]{26}$	ntfset_01gtyac3wjcdtjs8csc0219x1p
Product	pro_	^pro_[a-z\d]{26}$	pro_01gsz4vmqbjk3x4vvtafffd540
Price	pri_	^pri_[a-z\d]{26}$	pri_01gsz91wy9k1yn7kx82aafwvea
Report	rep_	^rep_[a-z\d]{26}$	rep_01hvgdpayq6kjzyk4hz5m02cpn
Subscription	sub_	^sub_[a-z\d]{26}$	sub_01gvne45dvdhg5gdxrz6hh511r
Transaction	txn_	^txn_[a-z\d]{26}$	txn_01gt261m3y0bngp73j1j8c6dge
Work with IDs
Paddle automatically generates IDs for you when you create entities using the API or dashboard. Use Paddle IDs to refer to entities throughout the Paddle platform.

Create entities
When creating entities using the API, Paddle returns the new Paddle ID for the entity in the response.

Get entities
When reading, updating, or deleting entities, use the ID to refer to the correct entity. For example:

GET
https://api.paddle.com/products/{product_id}
product_id
string
Paddle ID of the product to get.

List entities
When working with list endpoints, Paddle uses the Paddle ID of the entity you're working with as the cursor for pagination.

GET
https://api.paddle.com/products?after={product_id}
after
Return entities after the specified cursor.

product_id
string
Paddle ID of the product to use as the cursor.

Relate entities
Where entities are related, use Paddle IDs to link them. For example:

When creating a price, pass a product_id to set the product that a price relates to.
When creating a transaction, pass a customer_id and address_id to set who to bill.
When the subscription.created event occurs, it includes the transaction_id of the transaction that resulted in this subscription being created.
Sort by ID
Paddle IDs are lexicographically sortable. Sorting by Paddle ID results in the same order as sorting by the creation date of an entity.

Data types
Make requests to the Paddle API in JSON. Paddle responds in JSON.

The Paddle API uses JSON formatted data for requests and responses.

When making requests, specify application/json as your Content-Type. For example:

cURL request

curl -X POST https://api.paddle.com/customers
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pdl_live_apikey_01gtgztp8f4kek3yd4g1wrksa3_q6TGTJyvoIz7LDtXT65bX7_AQO" 
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  -d "{ "name": "Sam Miller", "email": "sam@example.com" }"
Paddle always sends responses as JSON. This includes errors as well as success responses.

Dates and times
All dates and times use the RFC 3339 format. For example:

Time and date	RFC 3339
3:30 PM on March 20 2024	2024-03-20T15:30:00.00Z
2 AM on January 12 2025	2025-01-12T02:00:00.00Z
8:50 PM on October 12 2025	2025-10-12T20:50:00.00Z
Timezones
Paddle supports over 200 countries and territories, so dates and times are UTC.

Money
Monetary values are returned as strings in the lowest denomination for a currency. For example, the API returns values in cents for USD and pence for GBP.

Many currencies have two decimals, but this can vary. For example:

Currency	Decimals	Example	Value
USD	2	$24.99	"2499"
JPY	0	¥1000	"1000"
We recommend using a currency library to format monetary values to the correct number of decimals. They can also help you format values for different locales and currency standards, making sure that currency symbols are placed correctly and the correct decimal separator is used.

For convenience, the preview prices operation returns formatted_unit_totals and formatted_totals objects alongside objects that return totals in the lowest denomination for a currency. Formatted totals objects return values formatted for the country or region you're working with, including the currency symbol.

For a full list of supported currencies and their decimals, see Supported currencies

Custom data
You can add custom data to some entities in Paddle. Custom data must be valid JSON.

Custom data
Attach arbitrary key-value data to entities in Paddle when working with the API or checkout. Typically used for storing metadata or other useful information when working with third-party solutions.

Custom data lets you add your own structured key-value data when working with some entities in Paddle. You can add it when working with the checkout or when creating or updating entities using the API.

Once added, you can see custom data:

When getting an entity or listing entities using the API.
In webhook responses.
In the Paddle dashboard against an entity — some entities only.
It's great for adding information that you might want to pass through to third-party integrations, like a CRM or analytics solution.

Custom data must be valid JSON, and you must provide at least one key.

Add or update using the API
You can add custom data to:

Products
Prices
Discounts
Transactions
Subscriptions
Customers
Addresses
Businesses
To add custom data to an entity using the API, include a custom_data object when creating or updating entities.

For example, to add custom data when creating a product:

POST https://api.paddle.com/products

{
  "name": "AeroEdit Student",
  "tax_category": "standard",
  "description": "Essential tools for student pilots to manage flight logs, analyze performance, and plan routes, and ensure compliance. Valid student pilot certificate from the FAA required.",
  "image_url": "https://paddle.s3.amazonaws.com/user/165798/bT1XUOJAQhOUxGs83cbk_pro.png",
  "custom_data": {
    "features": {
      "aircraft_performance": true,
      "compliance_monitoring": false,
      "flight_log_management": true,
      "payment_by_invoice": false,
      "route_planning": true,
      "sso": false
    },
    "suggested_addons": [
      "pro_01h1vjes1y163xfj1rh1tkfb65",
      "pro_01gsz97mq9pa4fkyy0wqenepkz"
    ],
    "upgrade_description": null
  }
Add using the checkout
To add custom data when opening a checkout using Paddle.js, pass customData in the Paddle.Checkout.open() method call:


Paddle.Checkout.open({
  settings: {
    displayMode: "overlay",
    theme: "light",
    locale: "en"
  },
  customData: {
    "crm_id": 1234,
    "utm_source": "google"
  },
  items: [
    {
      priceId: 'pri_01gm81eqze2vmmvhpjg13bfeqg',
      quantity: 1
    },
    {
      priceId: 'pri_01gm82kny0ad1tk358gxmsq87m',
      quantity: 1
    },
    {
Any custom data against a checkout is against the related transaction. If a checkout is for recurring items, it's stored against the created subscription, too.

Rate limiting
Rate limiting applies to the Paddle API. Send up to 240 requests per minute before getting a 429 error.

Rate limiting helps protect the Paddle platform and make sure it works smoothly for everyone. It works by putting a cap on the amount of requests that an IP address can make in a certain timeframe.

If you send too many requests, you'll get an error with a 429 response code.

429 - Too Many Requests

{
  "error":{
    "type":"api_error",
    "code":"too_many_requests",
    "detail":"You have exceeded the allowed rate limit, please retry your request after the number of seconds in the Retry-After header.",
    "documentation_url":"https://developer.paddle.com/errors/too_many_requests"
  }
}
Our rate limits are designed to protect the Paddle platform from abuse and maintain system stability. The limits are high enough to handle sales and promotions, along with other spikes in traffic. Contact the Paddle Seller Support team if you think you may exceed the limits.

Rate limits
Rate limiting may change. We'll communicate any changes in plenty of time on our developer changelog.

Platform rate limits
All operations in the Paddle API are rate limited, except the preview transaction and preview prices operations.

An IP address can make up to 240 requests per minute.
If exceeded, subsequent requests return a too_many_requests error (429).
When you get this error, that IP address can't make another request for 60 seconds.
Subscription rate limits
Additional limits apply when updating subscriptions that result in immediate charges. For example, upgrading a subscription using prorated_immediately or full_immediately as the proration_billing_mode with no credit balance available.

An account can make up to 20 chargeable updates to a subscription per hour, with a maximum of 100 per 24-hour period.
If exceeded, subsequent requests return a subscription_immediate_charge_hour_limit_exceeded or subscription_immediate_charge_24_hour_limit_exceeded error (429).
When you get these errors, you can't make another immediate charge for that subscription until the next hour or day.
These limits apply on a per-subscription basis to help maintain a good customer experience. There's no cap on the total number of immediate charges across all subscriptions.
Handle rate limiting
When you get a too_many_requests error, it includes a Retry-After response header to let you know how long to wait before retrying your request. You should avoid making requests during this time.

To handle platform rate limiting, we recommend watching for too_many_requests errors and building a retry mechanism that runs when the limit has expired.

Avoid rate limiting
To reduce your risk of being rate limited and make your integration as performant as possible, it's good practice to design your integration to use as few requests as possible.

You can use the include parameter to get related entities when making a request, rather than making multiple requests. For example, you can include all related prices when getting a product:

GET
https://api.paddle.com/products/{product_id}?include=prices
product_id
string
Paddle ID of the product entity to work with.

include
array[string]
Include related entities in the response. Use a comma-separated list to specify multiple entities.

Rather than sending requests in a loop, we recommend:

Subscribing to webhooks to let you know when something's changed.
Caching data that you'll use again for a short period — especially if you're building client-side applications.
If you're regularly being rate limited, contact the Paddle support team who can help.

Success responses
When a request is successful, Paddle returns a data object or array with a 2xx HTTP response code. List endpoints return a data array and metadata object with pagination information.

The Paddle API always returns requested entities in a data object or array. In most cases, it also returns a meta object with information about the request, including pagination information for list operations.

Success responses return a 2xx response code.

When there's an error, the API returns an error object instead. Errors return a 4xx or 5xx response code.

Get an entity
When you successfully get an entity, Paddle returns:

A data object with the requested entity.
A meta object with information about the request.
The response code is 200.

Errors
When a request fails, Paddle returns an error object with an appropriate HTTP response code. Errors are consistent and include information to help you troubleshoot.

The Paddle API uses standard HTTP response codes to let you know when something's wrong. It also returns some useful information to help you troubleshoot.

For a comprehensive overview of all the errors you might encounter when working with the Paddle API, check out our error reference. Each error includes common causes and information on how to fix.

HTTP status codes
Errors generally return a 4xx response code.

Though rare, you may get a 5xx response code. This means that there's a problem with the Paddle API rather than your code. Try your request later, or check our status page.

Success responses return a 2xx status code.

Error object
When you encounter an error, the API returns an error object rather than a data object or array.

Include and initialize Paddle.js
Include Paddle.js on your website to start building checkout experiences with Paddle. Initialize and authenticate by passing a client-side token.

Using script tag
Using JavaScript package manager
You can manually load the Paddle.js script on your website using a script tag.

Add the script tag to your HTML
Add the Paddle.js script to the <head> section of your HTML:


<script src="https://cdn.paddle.com/paddle/v2/paddle.js"></script>
Always load Paddle.js directly from https://cdn.paddle.com/. This makes sure that you're running with the latest security and feature updates from Paddle.

Initialize and authenticate
You need a client-side token to authenticate with Paddle.js. Create a token in Paddle > Developer tools > Authentication.

Never use API keys with Paddle.js. API keys should be kept secret and away from the frontend. Revoke the key if it has been compromised. Use client-side tokens starting with test_ or live_.

Initialize Paddle.js by calling the Paddle.Initialize() method with a configuration object that includes a client-side token as the token property:


<script src="https://cdn.paddle.com/paddle/v2/paddle.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  Paddle.Initialize({ 
    token: 'live_7d279f61a3499fed520f7cd8c08' // replace with a client-side token
  });
</script>
Setup Retain
Paddle.js integrates with Retain, so you don't have to include a separate Retain script in your app or website. Client-side tokens for live accounts authenticate with both Paddle Billing and Paddle Retain, so there's no need to pass a separate key for Retain.

You should initialize Paddle.js in the following places to take full advantage of Retain:

Public-facing page

Retain emails link back to your site, so customers can complete or confirm actions. Initialize Paddle.js on a public-facing marketing page that Retain can redirect to, like your homepage or pricing page.

In-app authenticated pages

Initialize Paddle.js on logged-in, authenticated pages so Retain can send in-app payment recovery and term optimization notifications, and display in-app cancellation flows.

Public-facing site
For public-facing pages, you can use the standard initialization script from the previous step without any extra configuration.

In-app authenticated pages
You need to include a pwCustomer object in the configuration object passed to the Paddle.Initialize() method. The id property of the pwCustomer object must be the Paddle ID of a customer entity. Other IDs and internal identifiers for a customer don't work with Retain.

pwCustomer
object or null
Identifier for a logged-in customer for Paddle Retain. Pass an empty object if you don't have a logged-in customer. Paddle Retain is only loaded for live accounts.

id
string
Paddle ID of a customer entity, prefixed ctm_. Only customer IDs are accepted. Don't pass subscription IDs, other Paddle IDs, or your own internal identifiers for a customer.


<script src="https://cdn.paddle.com/paddle/v2/paddle.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  Paddle.Initialize({
    token: 'live_7d279f61a3499fed520f7cd8c08', // replace with a client-side token
    pwCustomer: {
      id: 'ctm_01gt25aq4b2zcfw12szwtjrbdt' // replace with a customer Paddle ID
    }
  });
</script>
